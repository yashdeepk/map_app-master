Titan maps is a web application that gives the user an easier method to get around the fullerton campus.
#Function:
The main function of Titan Maps is to provide the user direction to the designated building and an estimated time of arrival. The application uses Google Maps to find the direction. There is also a warning sign at time intervals from the 30 minute mark (i.e. 8:00, 8:30, 9:00, and so on).  Titan Maps assumes that the class will be starting at the 30 minute mark and resets until the time reaches the next half hour.

#Operating Environment
Titan Maps runs on the web browser as a Web Application. The computer that is being used for the browser must be able to have locations found. The browser will ask the user to allow access to the user’s location, and the user must click on “Allow”.
